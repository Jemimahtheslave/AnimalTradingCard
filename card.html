				<p>The porcupine is a medium sized animal that grows to a length of 18 to 23 inches and weighs from ten to 28 pounds. In the northeast, it is brown and black in color with the back, sides, and tail covered in sharp uills. There are no quills on the porcupine's face, its underbelly, or the insides of its legs. It has powerful legs and large flat feet with strong curved claws on each toe. The porcupine is short and stout, which gives it a walking, armored ball appearance. It is slow moving, but agile enough to climb trees.</p>
